ARSO Weather Integration

This is a custom Home Assistant integration for ARSO Weather. It fetches real-time weather data, daily forecasts, and hourly forecasts from the ARSO API (Slovenian Environment Agency).
Features

Current Weather Conditions: Retrieves real-time weather observations from ARSO, including temperature, wind speed, pressure, and weather conditions.
Hourly and Daily Forecasts: Displays weather forecasts for each hour and up to 11 days ahead.
Cascading Logic for Weather Conditions: The integration uses cascading logic to determine weather conditions, checking clouds_icon_wwsyn_icon, wwsyn_shortText, and clouds_shortText to ensure accurate conditions are displayed.
Unique ID Support: Each entity now has a unique ID, allowing you to edit and customize entities in Home Assistant.
Slovenian Cloud Condition Translation: Slovenian cloud conditions are translated into English for compatibility with Home Assistant.
